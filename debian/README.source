pv for Debian
-------------

To build this package, follow those steps:

    uscan --download-current
    git-buildpackage

We use the "underlay" mechanism of git-buildpackage to build this. uscan
should also check the upstream OpenPGP signature block, even though
there is no confidence in the upstream key as it is not publicly signed.
